        <p class="p1">Reading Response: <a href="http://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf">The Garden of Forking Paths</a></p>
        <p class="p2">A Chinese agent or spy named Yu Tsun narrates the story, which is supposed to be his confession written as he awaits execution for spying for the Germans during the First World War. 

<p class="p2">When Yu arrive at Albert's place, he takes Yu for a walk around the ‘garden of forking paths’ outside the house. When they go inside the house, Albert tells Yu all about Yu’s grandfather, whose life Albert is something of an expert in thanks to his study of Chinese culture. He tells Yu that his grandfather, Ts’ui Pen, never managed to finish the novel he planned to write, but when he died he left behind a draft containing all of the various possible plot lines and discarded ideas.</p>
<p class="p2">He shoots and kills Albert, knowing that news of the man’s murder, and Yu’s involvement in it, will reach the Germans, who will realise that Yu is communicating to them the location of the artillery park: the town of Albert, in France. Yu ends his narrative by confirming that, because the town of Albert has just been bombed, he knows the Germans got his ‘message’.
