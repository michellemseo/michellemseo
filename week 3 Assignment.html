    <p class="p2">“Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you.”
    <p class="p2">I strongly agree with this statement that social media and its platforms that emerges nowadays are often focused on self-exposing rather than entertaining content. Thus, there are a lot of users that feel insecure or uncomfortable viewing such photos and videos. Websites or platforms that target communication that is much more focused on self-exposing are often found to be beneficial to the company, yet at the same time, has numerous controversial and sensitive issues within the user’s community.</p>  
    <p class="p2">The article was interesting in the way of approaching the website as a puddle, garden, plant, and many more, which focused on how to grow, organize and collect the website. The different and unique approach to creating the website seemed to be influential and creative.</p>

    <p class="p2">Modern “on” mode 
Content dissolves into context → context itself becomes content
<p class="p2">Non-modern, premodern, postmodern mode
Content provide its own context, and the environment grows in accordance with the emergent emanations of the inside
A few of the domains are as yet still empty, and a few others proffer short messages or other information. ཀ.com and ᠐.com both simply repeat the project’s opening salutation, that “Apache is functioning normally.”
Others, like ꇭ.com or 㐃.net, produce large textual patterns that mimic or otherwise reference the shape of the glyph itself

    <p class="p1"><a href="https://tilde.town/~zach/folk-html.html">Basic HTML</a>
        <p class="p2">“These days, I've gotten super into website building. I am teaching myself HTML so that I can make websites about ghost stories or comedy shows or things I ate that day. I am not sure why I was drawn to this. I simply wanted a creative outlet that felt pure and new, and basic web design was that outlet. I don't want the sites to look clean and professional. I don't want a website builders' marks on them. The more my sites look handmade (with my clumsy dumb hands), the happier I am”</p>

 <p class="p2">I also feel like websites nowadays seem to be very minimal, neutral, and modernized, but when some websites portray a specific brand, target, brand image, or even the author/creator’s unique style, the more impactful it is. Thus, I strongly agree with this creator explicitly showing all the raw writings and images.</p> 

 <p class="p2">“The majority of our internet usage is on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. If we are not scrolling through them, we are using them as a beginning channel to guide us to the rest of the internet. But these sites are not neutral platforms. They have their own agendas, and these agendas don't have the users best interests at heart. We all know this, we all know that Facebook is evil and that we are the products and twitter is toxic and on and on. But we feel there's no real alternative, and you feel lonely and weird if you're not on these sites, so you just suck it up and deal with it. Facebook is awful but it's good for learning about events, we say. Or we tell each other that if we want to have a good day, then stay off the internet and it's hordes of trolls, not realizing that by "the internet" we really just mean twitter and instagram.”</p>

 <p class="p2">As mentioned above, the most well-known and well-used platforms somehow seem to be out of the world’s business if not being used. And as the creator says, people should step aside from the significant websites rather than discover the internet and stay online.
