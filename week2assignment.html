                    <p class="p2">While watching the documentary, the message once again informed me how modern society and its people, called Generation Z, are found to have the most bonded relationship with technology: phones, laptops, watches, headphones, and more so. Thus, addiction to games and social media can happen very easily. Similar to the interviewers from the documentary, the amount of time used in media and in real life can be found to be very disproportionate. The less time an individual spend in real life, including sleeping, eating, communicating in person, attending class, and working on tasks leads to a lack of motivation and depression. 
                    <p class="p2">He also sees its glories and potential dangers alike on a much broader level. One chapter explores solar flares, and how the kind of cataclysmic event that could destroy satellites or fry entire networks is not just frightening, but ultimately inevitable, and completely beyond human control. This idea is central to Lo and Behold; Herzog sees the rapid evolution of technology as both beautiful and disquieting and understands that human dependence on it is unavoidable but nevertheless worrisome. After all, if all it takes to upend human existence is a solar flare, or even something as simple as the human element is the greatest flaw in even the most well-maintained network security, how can people go about their lives so complacently when it could all collapse at any moment? The answer is simple: anything can end the world at any second, so thereâ€™s no point living in any more fear of it than is necessary. The Internet was human-made, and humanity is chaos by its very nature.</p>
